## Contains:
- A map with multiple rooms.
- A clock system that advances the time each turn.
- A random secret killer who's chosen at the start.
- Hidden weapons on the map.
- Each weapon has its own class, which has its own rules. (i.e Gun is from the class Ranged. So the killer can kill without being in the same room as their target)
- 3 kinds of temperaments for the characters. Friendly, casual or angry. This will reflect in their behaviours.

- Character temperaments that influence others. Lowering or increasing group morale. (important beacuse the killer can ONLY attack when angry.)
- Characters that observe whats happening around them. After a body is found, each character will testify with information relevant to the case. What were they doing at the time? Where were they? Who did they see?
- A killer that **LIES** in their testimony. It's up to the player to find contradictions.
